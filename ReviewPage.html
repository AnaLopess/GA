  <h2>Horizon Forbidden West Review</h2>
  <h3>Horizon’s premise is a big mystery that begs to be solved.</h3>

  <img src="images/HomePageImage.jpg" width="80%">
  <p>There’s something about being dropped into a brand new game world and finding it to be dense with deeply considered
    lore, terrifyingly aggressive creatures, and tantalizing questions that leaves an indelible mark on the memory.
    Horizon Zero Dawn is one of those games, and it carves out a unique identity within the popular action-roleplaying
    genre. Coupled with wonderfully flexible combat and a story that touches on unexpectedly profound themes, I found it
    hard to tear myself away from Horizon even after I’d finished its main campaign some 40 odd hours later.
    Horizon’s premise is a big mystery that begs to be solved.
    “
    A sense of urgency is established from the get-go, as Horizon’s premise is a big mystery that begs to be solved. The
    questions raised by protagonist Aloy and the primitive, feral machine-infested open world she inhabits kept me
    guessing throughout: what’s at the centre of it all? Although Horizon suffers from occasionally corny dialogue that
    belies its smarts, the broader ideas it prods at - the nature of creation, for example - are remarkably ambitious.

  </div>
  <p>Horizon Zero Dawn didn’t demand a sequel. Its story felt complete when the credits rolled. We had taken Aloy from
    being an outcast of the Nora tribe to near-singlehandedly stopping a robotic apocalypse. That sense of resolution is
    increasingly rare for big-budget games of this size.
    It leaves the question, then: did a Zero Dawn sequel need to be made at all? Of course, we wanted to return to the
    strange futuristic, prehistoric Earth, where robotic dinosaurs stalk the land and tribes of humans try to eke out a
    living beneath their feet. But did it need to exist?
    In Horizon Forbidden West, Guerrilla Games proves Aloy’s story does indeed deserve another chapter. The game’s a
    grand technical achievement that feels “next-generation” and, importantly, also captures smaller, more human
    details, too.</p>


  <h2></h2>
  <p>In Horizon Zero Dawn, we see Aloy go from being a Nora tribe outcast to a world-saving hero. Forbidden West reveals
    the burden of that success. Her quest to find a solution to the Blight, a red plague that is sweeping through the
    world's wildlife and foliage alike, pushes her to head West, towards California. This land has been called the
    Forbidden West by the Carja due to the violent Tanakth occupying the region. Despite all her achievements in the
    last game, Aloy is a stranger in this new setting. She’s not alone though. Varl and Erend, her two companions from
    the first game are along for the fight, but the weight of her mission distances her from her friends. She is
    frustrated with the world. She is trying to save the planet from the Blight sweeping the land and yet she is running
    up against petty politics and squabbles.</p>
  <p>Soon after arriving in the Forbidden West she becomes embroiled in the infighting of the Tenakth and a rebel tribe
    run by a warmonger named Regalla who has been taught how to Override machines. This chase sends her on a massive
    journey that eventually widens the scope of the game's sci-fi setting much further than the previous game.
    While never uncaring, especially to the downtrodden and those in need, at the start of the game, Aloy is running
    from social connections. She quietly slinks off into the night to avoid accepting the help of Varl, pushes away
    Erend having left him after the first game without a word. She’s forcing herself into a lonely existence as she
    doesn’t want to burden others with the weight of her own.
    This is where the sequel shines. The story remains personal. Forbidden West is about reconnecting with humanity and
    forming, or reforming, friendships. And it works because of the rich characters that fill the world. Varl and Erend
    return, but the game has a broader interest in 'putting together a team'. That includes wonderful new additions to
    Aloy’s inner circle like Zo, a fierce personality from a largely peaceful tribe, and Kotallo, a brooding warrior
    dealing with the recent loss of an arm. Each character brings new perspectives, relating events back to you from a
    different angle. It fleshes out the world of Forbidden West and makes it feel lived in.</p>



  <h2>Weary feet</h2>
  <img src="images/H" width="80%">
  <p>While beautiful to look at, traveling across the Forbidden West can be a torrid affair. Aloy is a challenge to
    maneuver more often than she should be. Guerrilla gives you the ability to fine-tune your movement in the settings
    but it only goes so far. It's not uncommon for her to fail to grab onto ledges that you are clearly aiming for,
    sending her falling to the bottom of a long climb. She can also fail to mount ladders and sometimes snags on the
    scenery. Her movements are imprecise and interrupt your flow.
    It’s frustrating when the game looks so good but is a struggle to interact with. At its worst, this can get you
    killed, which can be eye-rollingly annoying. There is a missing fluidity to the movement that the experience is
    begging for. Also, when so much work has gone into putting you in Aloy’s shoes, it jars all the more when you stub
    your toe.
    This imprecise and clunky maneuverability becomes a particular nightmare when using a mount. Your ride can often be
    dragged from side to side or come to a halt as it tries to navigate the world.
    Exploration and platforming are a huge part of Forbidden West too, so this is a significant problem. It doesn’t ruin
    the game, but it holds it back more often than it should.</p>


  <h2>Epic combat</h2>
  <img src="images/HorizonFrobiden2.jpg" width="80%">
  <p>Horizon Forbidden West’s combat is an interesting dance to master that does have a surprising amount of depth to
    it. On top of the machines she must take down, Aloy will also spend a fairly significant time fighting human rebels
    of various tribes. Fighting people is entertaining but begins to feel flat as the best strategy remains powerful
    throughout the game - using Aloy’s time slow ability to shoot attackers in the head.
    The game really comes to life when trying to take down the machines though. Recognizing weaknesses in a hulking
    beast and exploiting them with your exotic arsenal is a blast. Taking on an Apex Tideripper with nothing but a
    couple of thrown-together electrical traps and some acid-tipped arrows is a hell of an experience. These elemental
    weaknesses bring depth to the combat, and learning to exploit them is rewarding. </p>
  <p>In the epic battles against Forbidden West’s massive machines, you need to master attack patterns, manage status
    effects, and look out for weak spots. These fights can be drawn out, especially in the early game when you’re still
    weak. And, while the battles are less demanding than those in games like Monster Hunter, they offer a faster, more
    fluid execution of a similar idea.
    As in Zero Dawn, you can also override these machines and have them fight alongside you. While many are on a timer,
    only fighting for you for a little while, when you get two hulking creatures to face off, it’s wildly impressive.
    Sneaking through the grass, overriding a Tremortusk, and having it fire on an aggressive Thunderjaw is an impressive
    spectacle. In the Horizon games, you are a small, vulnerable human in a dangerous world. Nothing quite brings that
    home-like watching giant robotic dinosaurs tear each other apart before your eyes.</p>
