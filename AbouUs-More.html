<p>Los Angeles, CA, July 20, 2021 - Last year, many media outlets and influencers rallied to fill the void left by the first cancellation of the annual E3 Expo since its inception in 1995. Despite a pandemic locking people down in their homes across the globe, there were still video games to show off and reveal, and developers who didn’t want to miss out on their chance to communicate directly with the fans. With that in mind, Game Radar produced a very successful multi-day reveal event with Summer of Gaming, bringing a familiar mix of game reveals, developer showcases, and in-depth developer interviews in a less familiar, all-digital format.  Based on the huge success, Summer of Gaming returned in 2021– with some major new additions.
 Game Radar’s 2021 Summer of Gaming was the Presenting Media Partner of the ESA for E3 2021 with showcases from top gaming companies including Microsoft, Nintendo, Capcom, Square Enix and more. Game Radar also partnered with Geoff Keighley’s 2nd Annual Summer Games Fest which aired on June 10, followed by Game Radar Expo with exclusive announcements, game reveals, and gameplay reveals on June 11.
  Over 141 million viewers tuned into Game Radar’s Summer of Gaming content on Game Radar’s platforms from June 10-23rd, with more than 1.5 billion impressions on YouTube and 588 million impressions on social media.
  Game Radar’s digital events season continues with more showcases, more game reveals, and more exclusive content throughout July and August – with comprehensive coverage of EA Play, Comic-Con @ Home, plus our Game Radar Premiere slate of entertainment exclusives from some of the biggest entertainment and streaming partners. Game Radar is excited to be partnering with gamescom again this year as the official English-language media partner, kicking off on August 25. 
  Game Radar’s Summer of Gaming 2021 is sponsored by Duracell, Metro by T-Mobile, and USAA.
